def calc_dem_from_dsm(dsm: xr.DataArray, pixel_size, sampling_meters):
    """
    Calculate a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from a Digital Surface Model (DSM) using sampling parameters.

    This function takes a Digital Surface Model (DSM), a pixel size, and a sampling distance in meters
    as input and generates a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) based on these parameters.

    Parameters:
        dsm (xr.DataArray): A Digital Surface Model represented as an xarray DataArray.
        pixel_size (float): The pixel size in the same unit as the DSM data.
        sampling_meters (float): The distance in meters to define the sampling grid for DEM creation.

    Returns:
        xr.DataArray: A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as an xarray DataArray containing elevation values.

    The function works by creating a grid of points at the specified sampling distance and then finding
    the lowest elevation value within each grid cell in the DSM. The resulting DEM is based on these minimum
    elevation values.

    Note:
        - This function uses the rasterio library for Geographic Information System (GIS) operations.
        - The DSM and DEM should have the same coordinate reference system (CRS) for accurate results.
        - Depending on the resolution of the DSM, this process can be time-consuming.

    Example Usage:
        dsm_data =  rxr.open_rasterio("dsm.tif",mode = "w")  # Load DSM data from a GeoTIFF file
        pixel_size = 1.0  # Specify the pixel size in meters
        sampling_distance = 10.0  # Define the sampling distance in meters
        dem = calc_dem_from_dsm(dsm_data, pixel_size, sampling_distance)  # Calculate the DEM
